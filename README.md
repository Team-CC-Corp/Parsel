Parsel
---

Parsel is a monadic parser combinator library based on [Parsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec).

With Lua being a dynamic typed language, monads are... cumbersome to implement. But regardless the concept makes for a much cleaner parser library than anything I've used in Lua thusfar.
